This is a bare-bones GLSL fragment shader boilerplate for Artblocks/Fxhash generative art projects.

For development, use the fragmentShader.glsl and vertexShader.glsl to make changes

Once the code is ready to be uploaded, insert the code for both fragmentShader and vertexShader in the artblocks.html file, so that it contains all of the code needed for the project.

The artblocks.html file will then be the one to be uploaded to Artblocks/Fxhash.

Make sure to remove the pseudo-tokenData that is generated for development purposes, as this will be provided by Artblocks upon rendering on the platform, see: https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/#code-templates-by-dependency-type.
